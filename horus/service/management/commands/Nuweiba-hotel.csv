Crashing of the waves beneath a panoply of stars.  Here, luxury has a different spelling.  The accommodation is equipped with everything essential for living. Not more. Comfortable beds, furniture made from palm branches, electricity for light.  Nothing disturbs the perception of the essential: starry sky, desert wind and the crashing of the sea.  Desert ships and coral reefs. When – if necessary at all – using the faux-pas word ""active holidays,"" here it gets a different meaning: may it be simple (simply) relaxing in unspoiled nature, walking or jeep safaris, snorkeling, reef-diving, belly dancing or camel riding –  the German owners help their guests to obtain the well-being you have been dreaming of..... The healthy savoury cooking of the managing lady surely contributes to this. You will find 22 robust bungalows covered with straw, clean sanitary equipment and a characteristic wild private coral beach which nestle in the natural rock surroundings made only by the hands of God. This resort, under the management of German emigrates, appeals to (approaches) all travelers who simply want to fully enjoy the breathtaking beauty of the Sinai.  There is something that can easily be left behind: the word ""duty."" Arabian calmness (equanimity) rules the resort. Only one thing cannot be avoided: A laid-back chat with bedouines passing by, accompanied by a sweetened tea on a soft cushion in a tent.  The best period for visiting the RockSea resort runs from late summer to late middle European spring. Workshops (seminars) and experiences in the dome. A big tent in form of a dome offers rest and space for teams and groups who want to freshen (up) their stay through seminars (workshops) or other common experiences at the foot of the Sinai. Whether it be dance, yoga, lectures, meditation or role-playing – it is you who decides.  Simply speak to the management of the resort in time to make sure that the equipment and media meet your expectations.  The RockSea Resort at the foot of the Sinai – far away from the busy Egyptian spas  - represents on oasis for travelers who want to relax with all senses - away from the hustle of crowded pools and animations.
